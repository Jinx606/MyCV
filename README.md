        <br>
        <div class="bio">
            <p> Hello there! My name is Jacolien Wilson, or you can call me Jacky if you prefer.
            <br>
            <br>
            With a passion for organization and efficiency, and a background in offering comprehensive administrative and personal support, I'm genuinely thrilled about the opportunity to make a positive impact on your team.
            <br>
            <br>
                My journey towards my dream of studying software engineering prompted me to take the courageous step of
                transitioning
                from my role as an executive personal assistant and reservations manager.
            <br>
            <br>
                In this role, I adeptly managed
                calendars and
                schedules, showcasing my affinity for time management and organization.
            <br>
            <br>
                I find joy in bustling environments where
                my ability to handle multiple tasks and communicate effectively thrives. This proficiency not only extends to administrative tasks
                but also encompasses staff management.
            <br>
            <br>
                My unique blend of skills consistently yields heightened productivity and success within the businesses I've been a part of.
            <br>
            <br>
                Beyond my professional life, I'm
                deeply passionate about coding, which aligns harmoniously with my desire to study software engineering.
            <br>
            <br>
                When I'm not immersed in the digital realm, I seek
                adventure through hobbies like rock climbing, running, camping, and hiking in nature.
            <br>
            <br>
                Incorporating my enthusiasm for organization, multitasking finesse, and strong communication skills, I'm eager to bring my diverse skill set to your team and
                contribute positively to its growth and accomplishments.
